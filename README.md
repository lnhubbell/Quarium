Quarium

#Overview
The Tweetquarium is a small online baubel with no utility whatsoever. It does provide a certain air of mesmerizing charm though. The site diplays tweets, represented by 'bubbles' that float up the screen over a background of a soothing aquairum video. The background can be switched to 'space style' as well. Finally, the user is able to enter a word, and tweets containing the chosen word will appear.

#Room for Improvement
As this is a project I'm working on in my spare time, there are a number of way it could be improved. To get more info on this, please few the open issues.
